# HouseFinder

HouseFinder is a React Native app that helps users find houses using Realtor API.

## Running the project

To run the project, it's necessary to have a realtor api. You can use [rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com/) to do it, it's free.

When you have your API working, fill `.env` with the necessary url, key and host, as follows:

```bash
//example
API_URL=https://realtor.p.rapidapi.com
XRAPIDAPIKEY=<PROVIDED_KEY>
XRAPIDAPIHOST=<PROVIDED_HOST>
```
